I have started back up on my homepage trying to play with the css so i can have my pictures centered and showing the image. 
Jumped on gimp and made a graphic of my google page so i can showcase it in its block on the home screen.

Things to do next session:

~~Add the picture to my folder.~~
Adjust picture to fit the box selected for my google frontend project.
